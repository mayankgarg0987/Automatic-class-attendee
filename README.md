This repository is about creating simple python scripts and using Task Scheduler to automate those scripts which will automatically attend your classes according to your time table.
By understanding this concept, you can use to automate your other stuffs too.

**What is this project about and why did I make this?**
This project is about a script that would attend your classes and you just need to have your computer started for it and connected to the Internet. That’s it! Isn’t that exciting? I’ll show you how I did that.
So, I was looking for some python language courses on youtube and I came across a video, titled as ‘Web automation in python for beginners’ by Hitesh Choudhary. I find this youtube channel to be amazing and I recommend you to check it out. This title excited me and I thought to have a watch. I found that to be amazing and thought to have a shot at it, though I was looking to start with python.
